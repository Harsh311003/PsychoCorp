          <p>Some anxiety is normal, but if worries and fears are preventing you from living your life the way youâ€™d like, you may be dealing with an anxiety disorder. According to the National Institute of Mental Health, anxiety disorders affect 40 million Americans a year. And if left untreated can lead to serious physical illness as well.

            Fortunately, anxiety disorders typically respond well to treatment. Many individuals who seek treatment go on to lead healthy, productive lives. In general, most anxiety disorders are treated with behavioral therapy or counseling, medication, or some combination of the two. In addition, a compassionate and understanding social support network can be instrumental in the recovery of a person with an anxiety disorder.

            If you think you or a loved one is suffering from an anxiety disorder, consider contacting a mental health professional or anxiety therapist for a complete evaluation.</p></div>
