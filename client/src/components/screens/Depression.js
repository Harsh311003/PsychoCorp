          <p>On occasion everyone feels sad or blue, but these feelings are usually temporary â€“lasting only a few days. If feelings of depression last for an extended period of time, interfere with daily life and normal functioning you may be suffering from a depressive disorder. Depression is a common but serious illness, and most who experience it need some form of help or treatment to get better.

            Depression affects close to 10% of the population. Women experience depression at roughly twice the rate of men. However, intensive research into the illness has resulted in the development of medications, psychotherapies, as well as a variety of self-help techniques that have proven to be very effective in the treatment of depression.</p></div>
